# Calculator
A simple calculator is a device or tool that is designed to perform basic mathematical calculations. It typically consists of a keypad with numerical buttons, as well as various function buttons for operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The primary purpose of a simple calculator is to provide quick and accurate solutions to mathematical problems.
I designed this calculator using HTML,CSS & JAVASCRIPT.
